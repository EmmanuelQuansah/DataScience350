    "\n",
    "A restricted version of Bayes Theorem was proposed by Rev.Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). Bayes Theorem, was published postumously by his friend Richard Price. Bayes' interest was in probabilities of gambling games. He was also a supporter of Isac Newton's new theory of calculus, with his publication, &An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst*.\n",

    "![](img/ThomasBayes.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "A version of Bayes Theorem which in its modern form was published by Pierre-Simon Laplace in Essai philosophique sur les probabilités 1814. Laplace applied Baysian methods to problems in celestial mechanics. These problems had great practical implicatons in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for the safe navigaton of ships. \n",

    "Dispite the philosophical squables, Baysian methods endured and showed an increasing number of success stories. Pragmatists continued to use both approaches. A number of success during the Second World War, with the philosophical battles raging, included:\n",

    "- Bayesian models used by Alan Turing to break German codes.\n",

    "## Baysian vs. Frequentist Views\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle between Fisher, Jefferys and their protégés continued for most of the 20th century. This battle was bitter and often personal. The core of these argument were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fisher argued that the selection of a Bayesian prior distribution was purely subjective, allowing one to achieve any answer desired.\n",
    "- Jefferys argued that all knowledge is in fact subjective, and that choosing a confidence interval was subjective in any event.\n",
    "\n",
    "With greater compuational power and general acceptance, Bayes methods are now widely used in areas ranging from medical research to natural language understanding to web search. Amoung pragmatists, the common belief today is that some problems are better handled by Frequentist methods and some with Bayesian methods.\n",

    "Let's summarize the differences between the Baysian and Frequentist views. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian methods use priors to quantify what we know about parameters.\n",
    "- Frequentists do not quantify anything about the parameters, using p-values and confidence intervals to express the unknowns about parameters.\n",
