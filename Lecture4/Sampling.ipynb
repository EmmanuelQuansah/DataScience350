    "Sampling is a fundamental process in the collection of data. Sampling is important because we can almost never look at the whole population. Some key points to keep in mind about sampling are:\n",
    "- We use inferences on the sample to say something about the population.\n",
    "- We need estimates of variances on the sample calculations to say something about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of sampling.\n",
